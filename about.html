        <div class="about">
            Kedarkantha (not to be confused with the popular Temple Kedarnath) is a 6-day long trek in Govind Pashu
            Vihar National Park in Uttarakhand (6 when including the travel days from Dehradun to the base camp and
            back). Kedarkantha is easily one of the most popular treks in India — popular amongst seasoned trekkers and
            beginners alike. <br>

            There are many reasons why it is a very popular trek to do in the Indian Himalayas. The most important of
            them is this — the summit climb. <br>

            The summit climb of Kedarkantha is a very rewarding one. Right from the base camp of the trek, the summit
            looms large. As you start your trek in the early hours of the morning and steadily climb up the steep slope
            of snow, the world opens up around you.
            <br>
            The climb is not easy. The entire stretch is steadily steep. As you get closer to the summit, it gets tricky
            as well. But the big mountains of the upper Himalayas keep you company until you finally reach the summit.
            <br>
            As you stretch yourself and take in the views of the Himalayas from the summit, you feel a strong sense of
            satisfaction and accomplishment. This is an unparalleled feeling.
            <br>
            Very few treks offer the same adventure, making it popular among beginners for its finest summit climb.
